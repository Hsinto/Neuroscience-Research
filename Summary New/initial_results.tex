\section{Initial Results}
\label{sec:Initial Results}

We have generated heatmaps of averaged network dynamics that showcase general patterns for size-$n$ networks across the full spectrum of edge connection probabilities and degrees of symmetry. Utilizing these heatmaps, we can see a distinct zone of phase transition where the dynamics go from coalescing to a fixed point to exhibiting strongly chaotic behavior.\sidenote{It should be noted that chaotic behavior persists for longer for larger $n$ graphs.}

Additionally, we have also identified that for networks of increasing size $n$, $n\to\infty$ results in the expected number of any fixed $k$-size clique going to 0, $\sigma_k \to 0$.
